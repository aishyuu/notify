### Tech Stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack Notify uses:

* This project uses the [React framework]('https://react.dev/') for the front-end
* For a fast front-end build tool, [Vite]('https://vitejs.dev/') was used for its instant server start, optimized builds, and Hot Module Replacement for a smooth development experience
* [TypeScript]('https://www.typescriptlang.org/') for type safety across the project to make sure everything works the way its supposed to all the time.
* For styling, [TailwindCSS]('https://tailwindcss.com/') was used for its convenience in styling my website without ever leaving the tsx file.
* For UI tools that were already prebuilt, I used [Material UI]('https://mui.com/'), which uses Googles design philosophy
